    "### What is query performance tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL tuning is the process of improving queries to accelerate server performance in the end. The purpose of it is to reduce the amount of time it takes a user to receive a query result after executing a query, and to reduce the amount of resources used to execute a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What goes behind a query?\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a software and its limited to the hardware that it lives in. Because this is something we can't change, what we can do is make the query to run faster is to reduce the number of computation. To do this, we'll need to understand what goes behind this computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Table size: The number of rows in the table matters. If one or more tables involved in the query has more tha millions or more rows, the performance will be affected.\n",
    "- Joins: If the tables are joined, this can also affect performance.\n",
    "- Aggregations: If there are aggregating functions involved over millions of rows, this will also affect performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query runtime can also be impacted by others that you cannot control. Remember, the database can and will be used by multiple peers, so having multiple peers executing resource-intensive queries, or systems working on ETL (extract-transform-load) jobs can also slow down your query runtime. These are something we can't control, so let's focus on things we can control."

    "\n",

You can use the `EXPLAIN` keyword to further study the query computation and see where you can possibly reduce computation.
